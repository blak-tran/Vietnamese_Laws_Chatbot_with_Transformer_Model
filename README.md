Transformer Model Training with TensorFlow

## Introduction
This project focuses on training a Transformer model using TensorFlow, a powerful deep learning framework. Transformers have proven to be exceptionally effective in natural language processing tasks, making them a popular choice for various applications such as chatbots, language translation, and text generation. In this project, we harness the capabilities of TensorFlow to train a state-of-the-art Transformer model tailored to your specific needs.

### Features
Transformer Architecture: Utilize the advanced Transformer architecture for processing sequential data efficiently.
TensorFlow Implementation: Leverage the TensorFlow framework to seamlessly build, train, and evaluate the Transformer model.
Customization: Tailor the Transformer model to your specific task, whether it's chatbot responses, language translation, or any other sequential data task.
Easy Integration: Easily integrate the trained model into your applications for real-time processing.
